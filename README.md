# Can we leverage capitalism in order to boost AUTO-GPT's performance? 

- Each autogpt agent is allocated a budget and granted the ability to spawn a full instance of itself as employee.
- This creates a swam of auto-gpt agents, forming a single organization with one "founder" at the helm. 
- Employees can message eachother, and access eachothers files via a pseudo-email system.
- Supervisors can grant budget to employees. 

If you dislike money you can activate death-mode which will allows the agents to run concurrently. However, this will escalate
very quickly so please dont.
