Deep Q Learning Concepts and Methods: Combining Q-Learning with deep neural networks to approximate the values in reinforcement learning, making it practical for larger environments with many states and actions. The Q-function determines the optimal action to take in a given state, representing the expected cumulative reward of taking that action and following a specific policy. Implementing Deep Q-Learning can be challenging due to the non-linear nature of the Q-function, so techniques like experience replay and target networks are used to address these challenges.

Applications: Artificial intelligence and machine learning tasks such as optimization, decision making, and game playing. Notable examples include training agents to play games like Atari and Go, as well as controlling robots for tasks like grasping and navigation.
