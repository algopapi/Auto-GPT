Deep Q-Network: Approximate the Q-values for each possible action at a state using a deep neural network.\n2. Loss function: Create a loss function to compare the Q-value prediction and the Q-target, and use gradient descent to update the Deep Q-Network weights.\n3. Two-phase training: \n   a. Sampling: Perform actions and store observed experience tuples (state, action, reward, and next state) in a replay memory.\n   b. Training: Select a small batch of random tuples and learn from this batch using a gradient descent update step.\n\nAdditional solutions for improved performance and stability:\n\n1. Experience Replay: Use a replay buffer to save experiences and allow the agent to learn from the same experiences multiple times, reducing correlation between experiences.\n2. Fixed Q-Target: Utilize a separate network with fixed parameters for estimating the TD Target and periodically copy the DQN network parameters to update the target network.\n3. Double DQN: Decouple action selection from target Q-value generation by using the DQN network to select the best action for the next state and the Target network to calculate the target Q-value of taking that action at the next state, reducing overestimation of Q-values.\n\nLinks: ['\\nHugging Face (/)', '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tModels (/models)', '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDatasets (/datasets)', '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSpaces (/spaces)', '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDocs (/docs)'] ","Assistant Reply: {\n  \"thought\": {\n    \"text\": \"My manager is asking for an update on the Deep Q Learning algorithm implementation.\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"I need to inform my manager about the current progress.\",\n    \"plan\": [\n      \"1.
